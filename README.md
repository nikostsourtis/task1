# task1

Approach

I put aside my normal tools because it’s a small project that didn’t need much power. It would be like to kill an ant with a bazooka.
I carefully read the requirement to understand what I needed to do.
I started writing the back-end code first and then moved to the front-end.
As soon as I had the data, I need from the ajax call, I styled the page.
You can see in my php loop that I could return a json object, but I used a simpler approach.
I colour coded all three messages based on severity.
I added a delay on the data. Also, if data would take much longer, I would add a ‘loader’ icon to be shown until all data loaded.
I would use different folders for assets, js files, css files if needed.


Future plans

I would use symfony and bootstrap for a larger project.
I would provide statistics regarding the dataset. I would use chartjs for graphs representation. I have used chartjs for reporting JIRA tasks/bugs that I have retrieved from JIRA’s api.
More testing on different browsers and operating systems.
Use of icons to make it easer for the user to read.
